To better understand the Secure Hash Algoritm (SHA), use the BitVector module to create an implementation of SHA-512. You can check the correctness of your work by comparing the hash values produced by your code with those produced by Pythonâ€™s hashlib library.

Your program should have the following call syntax :

sha512.py &lt;name of input file to hash&gt; &lt;name of hashed file (output)&gt;

You can include the round constants <em>K<sub>i </sub></em>in the program file.
